### A universal Anemone theme for all iOS devices supported by Anemone!

## Why is this theme named this way?

Icons for this theme have been created either by making new Icons using Microsoft Word

## Are all new icons created completely in Word?

Yes. All of the icons have been created in Microsoft Word

## Why Microsoft Word?

Well, it was originally a joke that icons better than Apple's own could be made using Microsoft Word. This theme is just a proof of concept

## So few icons?

The goal of this theme is to blend with stock icons, so the "good" stock icons should look themed even though they aren't. That being said, 100 icons is the minimum to submit to a repo and we're hoping to reach that soon.

# Criteria for icon requests

Icon requests should only be made if the stock icon looks awful (e.g. stock Settings/Safari icons) or if a submission can be offered that is an upgrade over the stock icon (even if the improvements are minor).

# Contributing

### Which word version is needed?

The theme was made using Word 2016, although Word 2010 or higher should work fine.

### Am I allowed to use GIMP?

Yes, but only to export icons from Word. Significant edits are not allowed.

### Am I allowed to use Photoshop?

Yes, but only to export icons from Word. Significant edits are not allowed.

### What files do I need to upload with my icon

For WordArt icons: You must upload the original docx file. If any post-processing is done, also upload the xcf file for GIMP

### What about the ReverseGradient icons?

Those are being phased out and replaced. Icons may only be made in word to comply with default repo criteria.
